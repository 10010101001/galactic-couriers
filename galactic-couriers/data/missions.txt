			`After getting closer to the station of obvious Korath origins, you notice that the docking ports are heavily modified. Your ship has no problem docking, the atmosphere inside the station is also the perfect composition for humans, so you continue with the standard docking procedures and equalize the air in your ship with the station.`

You didn't even realize that there is artifical gravity in the station, something very unusual with structures like this.`
			`	There are multiple levels of the atrium, connected with stairs and elevators. In the sides are service bays for Korath drones that have been converted by the human inhabitants into bars, shops, offices, and living spaces.`

A couple dudes who supposedly stole some alien tech but were chased into hiding by some other dudes who wanted the tech for themselves. I once ran into one of the Courier captains in the spaceport, I expressed to him my concerns about a possible civil war breaking out, and he offered me to live here and work for them. Of course I agreed, this part of space is calm, there are no pirates here, and no threat of an interstellar conflict breaking out. All I have to do is occasionally fix some of the machines on this station. Pretty fine life if you ask me."`

The only way to get there is by an elevator, where you're met by a security guard. After explaining to him your situation, he agrees to escort you to the leader of the Couriers.`

I was a starship captain like you, <last>, although instead of political affairs I gained my wealth and relative freedom thanks to my success in the corporate world. You may have heard of my company, the 'Galactic Couriers'..."`
			`	He crosses his hands and laughs, "...what a stupid name. But, nontheless, it was a huge success. While most independent merchants transport goods or people from one place to another, we managed to coordinate our operations. We built a network of freight routes that allowed us to transport cargo with a much higher efficiency, regardless of its source or destination; instead of one fleet of ships doing all the work, we set up transfer points where smaller freighters could load their cargo into large ones and in the process decrease the overall operating costs that come with flying small ships long distances."`
			
			choice
				`	"So what happened that made you move all the way here?"`
				
			`"Many things," Novak responds, "the first and very obvious issue we had to face were pirates. The precise flight schedules that allowed us to maximize efficiency also meant that our freight fleets were easily predictable, a single leaked document would allow pirates to set up a perfectly timed ambush. Each raid delivered three very damaging blows to the company, we lost good people, making it harder to employ new crew, we lost ships, many of which were leased, worsening our credit rating, and we also lost the cargo, giving our customers more reasons to doubt the safety and reliability of our services."`

Our employees and their family members started receiving threats, that if they keep working for us bad things would start happening to them. We don't know who sent those threats, I suppose not any of the pirates, because they wouldn't gain anything from our company going out of business. We tried to get the authorities involved, but they mysteriously couldn't find any clues. Anyone who did that must've had very good connections in the right places, they probably overheard that some of our ships were equipped with alien technology and wanted a piece of the action for themselves."`

We knew that the Syndicate and some free captains managed to snatch some from alien raids in the east, but we made ourselves an exceptionally large target by outfiting many of our ships with the drives. They were perfect for jumping between systems without links, it allowed us to confuse the pirate raiding parties and it also made many of our routes shorter. Of course, we didn't want to raise much attention when using them; we entrusted only our highest ranking pilots with them, and we made sure to use them only in empty systems or far away from any other traffic. We equipped our ships with the highest-grade interference plating in an attempt to hide the jump drives from Navy scanners, but we were bound to attract some attention."`

We got only a handful from disabled Korath ships, but when the time came to relocate, we had to swap them between our fleets as they were going in and out of this star system. A fleet with jump drives would travel here, then the drives were all loaded onto a single freighter, sent back, installed on more ships, and the process could repeat."`

Anyway, I don't want to waste your time. Now that you've proven your worth, you will be granted access to better contracts.

We think that it used to be linked with the rest of the Korath space in the past, otherwise there would be no way for Korath drones to get here and set up the station in the first place, but we have no idea how the hyperspace links were severed. Another big mystery is why wasn't this system inhabited by the other Korath that have access to jump drives; a stable triple star system is extremely rare and has an immense energy output. Our standing theory is that the Korath still think that this system is inhabited by their drones. We also suspect that the planet this station is orbiting has extremely rich deposits of rare metals, but any attempts at setting up mining operations were hindered by the extreme atmospheric pressure and temperature."`

Oh, and since you made contact with them, we've also ran a few shipments for the Remnants. As far as the actual content of our shipment goes, I have no idea. When someone orders our services, we send a cargo inspector ahead of the actual freighter. He or she makes sure that the cargo is safe and legal, and if it is, it gets sealed in special containers designed to interfere with cargo scanners and then loaded onto the freighter. In the entire process, only the customer and the inspector know what the actual contents are. This way there's almost no possibility for information leak and thus the risk of raids and ambushes is minimized. Our customers also welcome the privacy. The inspectors are highly-trained professionals, many of them are ex-Navy officers, so the information is perfectly safe with them. Anything else?"`

Some of our scouts on guard duty in the nearby sectors also reported hostile Hai battleships nosing around, we don't know where they got the drives but it seems like we were lucky enough that none of them decided to pay a visit to this system.

When he spots you, he gestures you to join the debriefing.`
			`	"This is captain <last>", he says to the pilots. You introduce to each other and Novak continues, "While our stations seems to be relatively undamaged, we lost many ships and good pilots. The fleet we sent to defend Meliter was almost our entire defence force, we are now practically powerless. I assume that now the Korath know we're here, they will return, but given how we kicked their asses today, I expect them to take some time to regroup. We have to use this short window of ceasefire to our advantage and build up more defenses."`

They had no trouble dealing with them, and I noticed that some of their ships could cloak and completely disappear. Such technology would give us a huge advantage."`

As far as their governments are concerned, we don't exist."`

			`	The two then start arguing, but Novak interrupts them "The Hai's ties with the Republic are too risky.

We've noticed that small fleets of two or three Raiders often jump in and then land near the poles of the local uninhabited planets. We don't want to risk bringing the Starlings any closer, they depend on solar winds to actively replenish their cloak, but just by counting how many Raiders landed and how many took off, we're pretty sure that there are at least a few dozen in each system."`
			`	"A few dozen that will sooner or later launch another attack" says Novak, "an attack much stronger than the one you helped us fight through. We could barely survive back then."`
			choice
				`	"Why didn't you tell me sooner? I can help you."`
			
			`"Precautions" says Novak. He then nods at one of the other men in the room, a scientist, who starts explaining;`
			`	"As you know, our cargo dispatch can communicate with you anywhere in the galaxy, regardless of the hyperspace links. That is possible only thanks to salvaged Kor Sestor technology. Their automata are connected with a control center using a network that sends information almost instanteniously practically anywhere in the Milky Way. We're not sure if the Sestor developed it themselves or if it was created by their Korath ancestors, so we don't want to risk sending out messages that can be intercepted by the enemy."`
			`	"Chris is right" Novak continues, "in fact, we were planning to send a messenger for you in just a few hours. The fact that you came here right on time simplifies the situation."`
			`	Novak then turns his attention back the the group of pilots that he was talking to before you arrived, "Alright, so here's the plan. The Korath don't know that we're aware of their presence. As a result, they don't expect us to be prepared for their attack. I've secured a deal with one of our longtime customers in the Hai space. There's a group of Hai battleships equipped with jump drives parked in one of their uninhabited systems. They are manned entirely by our people. We need to get them here safely ASAP. Captain <last>, are you up for the task? It's just a quick and simple escort mission."`
			choice
				`	"I thought that you didn't want to work with the Hai?"`
					goto ask
				`	"Consider it done."`
					goto next
					
			label ask
			`"That's true," he says, "but we're not working with the Hai themselves. The battleships belonged to a retired human captain who knows about our situation. We bought them from her for a price much higher than any shipyard could offer her."`
			choice
				`	"Okay then, I'll go get them."`
					goto next
				
			label next
			`"Very well. While you're doing that, we're also going to pull in some more fleets of newly purchased human ships. Thanks to the minor Korath raids we now finally have jump drives to spare."`

Once you pass one of the mountain peaks, you spot a group of large Hai battleships resting in a circular pattern around a pond of spring water, you count about a dozen of them. As you get closer, one of them takes off and moves to a different spot so that your own ship would have enough space to land.`
			`	You land on the now free spot and walk towards the pond where many crewmen are already waiting for you. You notice that they set up a makeshift fishing camp around the pond to kill some time, even though it's very likely that there are no fish present.

			`You dock with the station and head for Novak's office to tell him that the Hai battleships are ready, but instead you are pulled aside by Chris, the scientist that attended the previous briefing with you.`
			`	"My name's Christian Zimmerman" he says, "mister Novak is busy right now, he told me to give you this once you return with the ships."`
			`	Chris reaches in his pocket and hands you a credit chip worth seven million.`
			`	"But before you go, captain" he continues, "I wanted to ask you for some help myself."`
			choice
				`	"What do you need?"`
				
			`"I work as the chief scientist for the Couriers" he says, "I was brought here mainly to research the Korath technologies on this station, but also to find out what happened to the hyperspace links in this system."`
			`	He then reaches into his second pocket of his lab coat and pulls out a tablet. On the screen you see a map of the Milky Way, but the only marked systems are the ones occupied by the Korath and their drones. Chris then zooms the view in on Meliter and you see that there is a link between it and Silikatakfar, a nearby star system.`
			`	"This map was recently retrieved from one of the data terminals on this station. This means that this system did have a hyperspace link while it was still inhabited by the Sestor."`
			choice
				`	"Maybe they severed it to protect themselves from the other automata?"`
				`	"The Pug have the technology to disrupt links, could they have something to do with it?"`
				
			`Your question seems to be completely ignored by Chris who instead keeps scrolling the screen until he finds a big block of text written in a language you don't understand.`
			`	"This is a variation of the Korath language" he says, "one that we have a very limited understanding of, but from what we've managed to translate, the Sestor drones were, and I quote, 'scared' of the 'entity' that appeared here. Obivously, machines like them can't feel fear the way living beings do, but even they would rather bail from a fight than stay and get destroyed."`
			`	He then scrolls the text a bit more, and continues;`
			`	"Some of the drones supposedly managed to escape using their hyperdrive, but for some reason many of them got stranded here when the link was severed. Instead, they used their engines to reach escape velocity, put their systems in a state of deep hibernation, and simply drifted away, towards the rest of the Sestor space. It probably took them hundreds of years, but that's not the point-"`
			`	Chris then gets interrupted by a Courier pilot calling his name. He apologizes and tells you to meet him in the spaceport once he's done.`

			`You go to the spaceport atrium as instructed, but Chris is nowhere to be seen. You figure that he's probably got a lot of work to do now that you brought in a large fleet of Hai battleships, so you decide to explore the local shops and bars while waiting.`
			`	Finally, after about 45 minutes of mindlessly wandering around, you spot Chris at the other side of the atrium. You wave at him and he starts going towards you.`
			`	"I'm sorry I kept you waiting for so long" he says apologetically, "anyway, now that we have some time I would like to-"`
			`	Once again, Chris is interrupted, this time by a siren and the station's intercom system;`
			`	"We have just received a report from one of our scouts" says Novak through the loudspeakers, "the Korath fleets are on the move. I repeat, the Korath are on the move. We've counted at least thirty battleships with even more on the way coming from their homeworlds. All civilians and non-critical personnel are instructed to board the nearest freighter and evacuate the system. All combat pilots are required to take defensive positions."`
			`	One of the Courier security guards then approaches you and shows Chris the way to the neares freighter.`
			`	"I know you'd like to stay, but I'm afraid we can't lose you mister Zimmerman" says the guard to Chris.`
			`	Just like during the first raid, you don't seem to have any other option than to join the fight. Now that you've been associated with the Couriers, it's very likely that the Korath will pursue you if you try to escape.`

			`You dock with the station while the other Courier ships are still busy cleaning up the battlefield and salvaging as much Korath equipment as possible. The station is eerily quiet now that almost everyone has evacuated. The only person you meet is Novak.`
			`	"I'm glad you're okay" he says, "that was one of the most terrifying battles I've seen. I would've joined in myself, but someone had to stay behind and engage the self-destruct in case the station got boarded."`
			`	"You don't want it to fall back into Korath hands?" you ask.`
			`	"Of course not. Did you see what ships they just brought in? That must've been almost their entire homeworld fleet. There must be something about this station extremely attractive to them, and if its so important that they're willing to sacrifice a major part of their fleet for it, we can't let them have it."`
			choice
				`	"Any idea what that may be?"`
				
			`He thinks about your question for a second, and continues, "All those things that Chris pointed out, it must be no coincidence. A triple star system, immense solar activity, disappearing hyperspace links... Whatever the Sestor drones were doing here must've required unimaginable amounts of energy."`
			`	Suddenly you hear a voice from one of hallways leading to ship docking ports, "Exactly, and I think I just figured it out."`
			` 	It's Chris. He explains to you and Novak that instead of going on the freighter, he took his lab equipment onboard a Starling and stayed cloacked throughout the entire duration of the battle.`
			`	"I consider myself an optimist" he says, "but when I saw the reports from our scouts about the size of the Korath fleets, I was convinced that we'd lose. For a long time now have I suspected that what the Kor Sestor were developing here was a weapon. From the small bits of text we were able to translate, we found out that they were working on 'a device to channel energy into enemy territory', something like a long-range EMP, probably to interfere with the Mereti core systems. I hoped to rush my research and get it working before the Korath attacked, but I was too slow. But, thanks to <last>'s help, they were defeated the good old way."`
			`	"So, this weapon" says Novak, "that's what the Korath want?"`
			`	"I don't think so" Chris responds, "all evidence points to the fact that this 'device' was developed long after the Korath left their drones. I think what they want is this station and the triple star system, they could build many manufacturing plants and the stars would cover all their power requirements."`
			choice
				`	"Do you know where this device is?"`
				
			`Chris gets silent for a second and then looks around, "I think we're standing in it."`
			`	"The... station?" asks Novak.`
			`	Chris nods in agreement, "Yes, the station. When we started the modification of the station to support human inhabitants, I noticed a lot of details that just seemed... off. For example, the outer hull seems to be one big superconductor. Every time a solar flare hits us, there are strange energy buildups in the power grid, as if the energy of the star was being channeled by the station itself."`
			`	"Channeled where?" you ask.`
			`	"Right now, nowhere" Chris responds, "the system isn't fully operational. In fact, it seems to be badly damaged, likely from the last test that disrupted the hyperspace link."`
			choice
				`	"Didn't you say that this 'entity' severed the link?"`
				
			`"That's what we thought. We were never certain, but what I learned in the few hours I spent studying the Sestor records while the battle was going on completely changed my standing theory."`
			`	Chris then pulls out his tablet and starts frantically drawing something.`
			`	"This is how I think it happened" he explains, "this system was controlled by the Kor Sestor, but it was attacked by the Kor Mereti. The Sestor, not wanting the Mereti to gain access to the technology of this station, activated the weapon prematurely, when it wasn't fully completed. Their intent was to use it to tap into the energy output of the triple star system and redirect it towards the Mereti planets, stations, and factories. To do that, it would form a temporary hyperspace link between Meliter and its target and then send the full force three stars through it in a uniform beam."`
			`	He looks out of the window at the three suns of this system, and continues, "But, as I said, the weapon wasn't ready. It misfired. Instead of sending the power to the Mereti space, it sent it in a random direction. Now, I'm going to speculate, but I think it established a link with a star system in some other, distant galaxy."`
			`	"How distant?" asks Novak.`
			`	"Well, I looked at the power logs from the event, and if my calculations are correct, the length of the link was somewhere between seventy billion or a hundred billion light years. That means that for a short time Meliter was linked with a star system outside of our observable universe."`
			choice
				`	"That sounds impossible."`
				
			`Chris turns to you and continues, "That's because it is impossible, <last>. Even the full power of three stars shouldn't be able to sustain a link that distant. The only possible explanation is that the link was somehow amplified. But that's where my knowledge ends. Maybe it intersected a black hole, or a supernova. But once it was established, it allowed that 'entity' to traverse it. And whatever the entity was, it made the Sestor drones engage safety protocols and start evacuating the system. The weapon shut down before they all could run away, and once the link was cut, the residual power was enough to permanently disrupt the original link leading to the Sestor space."`
			`	"So where is this 'entity' now?" asks Novak, "Did it return through the link?"`
			`	"There was no time for it to return" Chris continues, "as soon as it entered Meliter, it engaged in a fight and the link collapsed mere seconds later. In fact, I think it never left this system. Or at least its proximity."`
			choice
				`	"You've been in this system for years, I'm sure you'd notice it."`

			`"During the battle, my ship's sensors started to pick up unusual energy bursts coming from deep space at the very edge of this system. As far as we know, the only things out there are a bunch of asteroids on extremely elliptical orbits."`
			`	Novak sits down on a nearby bench, takes a deep breath, and says, "Chris. Are you saying that this... thing, this entity or ship or whatever it is..."`
			`	"I'm afraid so, sir" says Chris, "we woke that thing up. The energy burst signature matches almost perfectly with the one in the old Sestor records, albeit much weaker. It was probably hibernating, and now entered a wake-up sequence."`
			`	A few seconds of silence follow. Finally, Novak looks at Chris and asks "How long before it gets here?"`
			`	"If its movement speed is consistent with the data from the records, I think we have only a few weeks before it manages to adjust its orbit. It doesn't appear to be equipped with a hyperdrive, so we should have enough time to evacuate."`
			`	You notice that many Courier ships docked back with the station and the atrium is becomming filled with people again. After a moment of contemplating the situation, Novak uses his radio to connect to the station's loudspeakers.`
			`	"Okay people, pack it up again, we got a code red, incoming hostile, this time we can't fight them off" he then puts down his radio, looks at you, and continues, "Captain <last>, once again we can use your help. There will be a few transport ship captains waiting for you in the spaceport. I'd really appreciate if you could help escort them to our backup outpost on Earth. I'll stay here with Chris to see if we can figure out a way to defend the station."`
