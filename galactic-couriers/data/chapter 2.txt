			`Shortly after your ship settles on the landing pad, a message appears on your computer.`
			`	'MEET US MELITER -NOVAK'`
			`	You check your map and notice that indeed there is a system present at the same coordinates as where Meliter was before the supernova, it seems like now that several months have passed, your navigation computer thinks it is once again safe for you to travel there.`

			`To your surprise, the station seems to have taken the supernova pretty well. The automatic docking system is still working flawlessly, and the life support and artifical gravity systems also seem to be operational. One thing you notice is that the station is extremely cold now that it's no longer receiving heat from three stars simultaneously.`
			`	All hallways and rooms are almost completely empty, during the evacuation the Couriers took with them pretty much anything that wasn't bolted to the ground. You can hear multiple echoes of each of your steps as you make your way towards the main atrium where you meet Novak, Chris, and a few other Courier pilots sitting around a large table - which you assume is the last piece of furniture left on the station - with drinks and military food rations on it.`
			`	Both Novak and Chris are visibly delighted to see you, and Novak invites you to join them.`
			`	"Came to join our little picnic, captain?" laughs Novak.`
			choice
				`	"Chris, are you alright?"`
			`Chris laughs and says "Alright? I've never been better, <last>! Seeing a triple supernova first-hand, right outside of these windows... I did my best to keep many external sensors on the station running and I managed to collect more data on these events than most Republic research efforts combined! In fact, most of the cameras on the outside stayed functional throughout the entire event, look..."`
			`	He then pulls out his tablet and scrolls through a directory full of short video clips from the different docking cameras of the station.`
			`	The first one shows the alien ship in detail as it engaged with the Korath, seconds after the last Courier fleet left the system. The ship is seen unleashing a rain of fast and deadly projectiles, destroying all the Korath battleships before they even have a chance to retaliate. At one point it drifts out of the camera's view, so Chris switches to another clip. When the last Korath ship explodes, the alien vessel turns its attention towards the station. It starts firing, but the first supernova goes off and sweeps the projectiles before they can reach the station. The vessel stops, its engines probably got knocked out in the blast wave, but the two additional stellar explosions manage to tear it apart, leaving almost no wreckage behind.`
			`	"The same happened to the planet the station was orbiting" says Chris, "the first explosion completely blown away its atmosphere and the two subsequent blasts just obliterated it."`
			choice
				`	"So both the weapon and the shields worked?"`
			`"The shields performed phenomenally" he says, "in fact, during the peak of the blasts they pulled in so much energy that I was afraid it may overload the weapon and trigger another detonation, this time inside the station. I was forced to activate it again to bleed the energy off, I targeted an empty spot in space and just let it channel the power there. Sadly, there wasn't much I could do to limit the current, the weapon and all of its control circuitry got completely fried."`
			`	"Maybe it's for the better" says Novak, "I'll sure be sleeping well, knowing that the thing that can pop stars with the press of a button is out of commission."`
			`	"Right," says Chris, "now that both the weapon and the triple star system are gone, there is no reason for the Korath to come here. Meliter just became another subpar Kor Sestor station."`
			choice
				`	"So the Couriers are over?"`
			`"Honestly," says Novak, "I have no idea. Many of the people that lived on the station just went back to living in the Republic. Can't blame them, after all, I promised them a calm and stable place to call home. And, at least in my opinion, three stars going nuclear is as far from 'calm' and 'stable' as you can get. But then there's the other group of people. They enjoyed the freedom that living in an isolated system far from human civilization gave them... some of them even enjoyed the thrill of piloting ships through alien territories and fighting the Korath. We are no longer a company, we're a community, and if we can find another place to call 'our own' then I'm all in for re-settling."`
			` 	You then chat for a little longer, but are often interrupted by power outages.`
			`	"The station is trying its hardest to keep the shields powered" says Chris, "I think we should go before the life support collapses."`
			`	While the Courier pilots are busy packing up anything left behind the evacuation, you say goodbye to Chris and Novak and prepare to head your own way, but not before Chris invites you to meet him in the research center on Earth once you have some free time.`

			`	Chris continues, "yes, when I fired the weapon for the second - and last - time, the station's sensors started to pick up a strange anomaly forming. I dismissed it as the effects of the supernova interfering with them, but even after it calmed down the anomaly persisted. You may have noticed it when you returned to Meliter. We have reasons to believe that the interaction of the weapon with the superheated matter ejected by the supernova has opened a wormhole from Meliter."`

			`	Neither you or McKay know what he's talking about, so Chris starts to explain.`
			`	"Before the wreckage of the alien ship was completely swept away by the solar winds, I sent one of the repair drones of the station to analyze it and retrieve any technology it could find. I lost contact with it shortly after it left the shield range, I thought it got fried, but according to these logs it actually managed to reach its destination." He shows a stream of data on his tablet, presumably representing infromation that is being downloaded from the drone.`

			`Once again you make your way to McKay's research center. You find him and Chris inspecting the two identical devices that you brought from Meliter.`
			`	"This is incredible!" says McKay, "This device... it must've been the alien ship's variant of a hyperdrive!"`
			`	"Indeed" says Chris, "the radiated energy signature is very similar to our own hyperdrives. Except much more... refined."`
			choice
				`	"What's so incredible about that? Everyone in the Milky Way has hyperdrives."`
				
			`"That is true," says Chris, "but this 'drive' seems to be intended for usage with much longer hypespace links. Our drives can travel interstellar distances in a single jump. But this one..."`
			`	He then looks at one of the nearby computer screens and continues, "...this drive was likely used to traverse intergalactic hyperspace links. That would explain how the ship could travel so far without any major damage being inflicted upon it."`
			`	"Sadly, we're missing the crucial pieces" says McKay, "it is very possible that these devices were only one part of the ship's hyperdrive system. By themselves they don't seem to be able to function as drives. But we think that we can interface them with our own hyperdrives and jump drives."`
			choice
				`	"And what would that do?"`
				
			`"On the surface," continues McKay, "not much. I think we could use these 'augmenters' - as I like to call them - to increase the performance of our current drives, allowing a ship with one of these installed to engage hyperspace jumps without having to bleed off all of its velocity. But that is not the main part..."`
			`	"We also think we can use this to traverse the wormhole that was formed in Meliter" says Chris, "and not only that, we can make the device resonate at any frequency we want, at the quantum level, so a ship equipped with one of these could also travel through the wormholes in the Ember Wastes region without the need of a keystone."`
			`	"Like a master key to the galaxy," laughs McKay.`
			choice
				`	"What do you want me to do?"`
			
			`"If you're willing to help us out," says Chris, "we will install one of these into your ship and the other into our own research vessel. I will go with you while McKay takes his research team on his ship."`

			`"The main risk is running into someone who doesn't like to be ran into" says Chris, "we would just go with our ship alone, but I will feel much safer having someone with more combat experience escorting us through. Otherwise, I am pretty confident it is perfecly safe."`
			`	"That said, make sure your ship is combat-ready" says McKay, "we've got only two of these, so you won't be able to take any more ships with us. Although, personally I don't think we'll have any trouble, after all, the wormhole likely leads to a relatively nearby place within the Milky Way."`

When piracy was at its peak, when the Republic explicitly ordered their ships to not assist the poor worlds in the south, the Couriers turned into a beacon of hope. Safety. At one point, Meliter was home to over fifty thousand refugees from planets that couldn't properly defend themselves. Obviously they wouldn't fit in the station, so we converted many of our freighters into temporary accomodations. All that and we still managed to keep a low profile, to operate 'underground', to avoid attracting any negative attention.`
